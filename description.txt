The code first checks if the result directory exists and creates if not. Then it also creates a new file named “output.txt” and if it exists it clears it out.
Then it reads line by line from the file in a while loop, there each line is split by gaps and stored into array. The array[0] then contains the first number, array[1] the second number and array[2] the operand.
Then the code proceeds according to the operand by the help of if-elif-else conditioning the the final result regardless of the operation is stored in the result variable.
Finally in the end the result is written in the file named output.txt.
At the end of program the message "Task terminated successfully" is shown.
